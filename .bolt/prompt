For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make the page have an Apple or Stripe type of interface with maximized CTA in UI/UX.

Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production. Make all buttons working and directable to someplace.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
